# legal-ops-agent

[![Python CI](https://github.com/sebastianfoerste/legal-ops-agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sebastianfoerste/legal-ops-agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

CI workflow and deterministic test suite are included.

See [CASE_STUDY.md](CASE_STUDY.md) for the problem, controls, and limitations.
Portfolio proof contract: [`docs/portfolio-proof.json`](docs/portfolio-proof.json).

Supervised legal-operations workflow: typed intake, deterministic risk triage, reviewer routing, human-approved export, audit trail. Legal advice is outside this prototype; data is synthetic.

**Public-safety posture:** synthetic matters only, explicit source provenance checks, an audit trail, a human review gate before export, and no legal advice.
Verification manifest: [`docs/verification-manifest.json`](docs/verification-manifest.json).
Verification guide: [`docs/verification-guide.md`](docs/verification-guide.md).

Claim-level evidence lineage: every surfaced finding, control, source decision,
routing decision, and export-gate result can be traced to a hashed input and the
deterministic local rule that produced it. Blocked source identifiers are
redacted before the lineage graph is rendered. Lineage coverage and evidence
assurance are reported separately, so a fully traced claim still enters an
explicit review queue when its source is blocked, unapproved, or requires a
lawyer to confirm currency and relevance.

Committed proof:

## Run it (90 seconds)

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make install
# 1) assess a synthetic matter, returns needs_review / export_allowed:false
python -m src.cli --input examples/matters/saas_msa_deviation.json
# 2) approve it with a documented human decision
python -m src.cli --input examples/matters/saas_msa_deviation.json \
  --approve-note "Approved after commercial counsel review of the synthetic MSA deviation." \
  --packet-output demo_output/saas-msa-review-packet.md
```

Runs the canonical local verification path end to end, offline and deterministically, over a
synthetic SaaS MSA deviation fixture.

Export stays blocked until approval is recorded. It also stays blocked after approval if a
blocker finding remains. Run the proof gate with `make check`.

## Architecture flow

1. `models.py` defines typed matter, finding, routing, review and assessment contracts.
2. `src/legal_ops.py` performs deterministic intake, risk triage and reviewer routing.
3. `src/source_verification.py` validates synthetic and public-regulatory source references.
4. `src/mcp_tools.py` exposes seven local MCP-style tools behind a controlled dispatcher.
5. `src/trust_cockpit.py` renders the reviewer-facing trust cockpit.
6. `src/review_packet.py` renders the lawyer-facing Markdown packet.
7. `src/cli.py` runs fixture-to-packet flows for local verification.
8. `runtime_agent/app.py` provides a small HTTP canary for local workflow checks.
9. Export stays blocked until a documented human approval clears the review gate.
10. `src/evidence_lineage.py` produces a coverage-checked claim provenance graph.

## What the demo produces

The workflow runs triage over a matter intake, generates deterministic findings, and routes to reviewers. Export remains blocked until a human reviewer records an approval decision. You can read the committed sample output: [`examples/matter-run.md`](examples/matter-run.md). The current source-verified verification snapshot is [`examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.md`](examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.md). The reviewer-facing trust cockpit snapshot is [`examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.md`](examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.md).

```markdown
# LegalOps Review Packet: Enterprise customer DPA review

- Review state: approved
- Export: allowed

## Routing
- Owner role: Privacy Counsel
- Reviewers: Legal Ops, Privacy Counsel, AI Governance Lead, Commercial Counsel, General Counsel

## Findings
- MEDIUM: privacy | Personal or customer data categories are in scope.
- HIGH: customer_commitments | The matter includes bespoke customer commitments.
- MEDIUM: ai_governance | AI processing or model-training restrictions require review.
```

In the sample run, export stays blocked until a reviewer approves; the audit trail shows who and when.

## What it checks / does

| Check / Step | Focus | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|
| Typed Matter Intake | Input validation | Ensures all details are provided according to strict Pydantic models |
| Risk Triage | Deterministic risk scoring | Catches known issues (e.g. data retention demands, specific vendor terms) |
| Source Verification | Provenance tracking | Verifies that references use allowed source prefixes and formats |
| Trust Cockpit | Reviewer evidence | Shows review state, source boundary, export gate, commitments and artifact integrity |
| Audit Integrity Chain | Tamper evidence | Hash-chains every audit event; export is blocked if the chain does not verify |

> **What workflow does this improve?** Recurring legal operations triage and gating.
> **Who is the user?** A General Counsel or Legal Operations lead running the workflow.
> **Where does human review happen?** At the Review Gate, which must be approved by the GC.
> **What is blocked until approval?** Persisted output and downstream data export.
> **What would I tell Product?** Real-world friction patterns and common DPA deviations to automate them in templates.

![Supervised review: a SaaS MSA matter triaged to high risk, routed to four reviewers, export blocked until human approval is recorded](docs/review-gate.svg)

## 90-second verification path

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
python -m src.cli --input examples/matters/saas_msa_deviation.json
```

The first run returns `review_state: "needs_review"` and
`export_allowed: false`. Inspect the risk decision, reviewer routing, source
verification records and audit trail in the JSON output.

Approve the same synthetic matter with a documented human decision:

```bash
python -m src.cli \
  --input examples/matters/saas_msa_deviation.json \
  --approve-note "Approved after commercial counsel review of the synthetic MSA deviation." \
  --packet-output demo_output/saas-msa-review-packet.md \
  --manifest-output demo_output/saas-msa-artifact-manifest.json
```

Export remains blocked until approval is recorded, and it remains blocked after
approval if a blocker finding is still present.

Run the verification gate:

```bash
make check
```

Write the claim lineage proof:

```bash
python -m src.cli \
  --input examples/matters/saas_msa_deviation.json \
  --lineage-output demo_output/evidence-lineage.json \
  --lineage-markdown-output demo_output/evidence-lineage.md
```

## Committed source-verified run

A dated verification run for the same synthetic SaaS MSA deviation fixture is committed
here:

- [`examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.md`](examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.md)
- [`examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.json`](examples/source-verified-saas-msa-run-2026-06-30.json)

The snapshot records `review_state: "needs_review"`, `export_allowed: false`,
`external_actions_allowed: false`, a synthetic source-reference pass and a
`local_review_only` policy envelope. Generated review artifacts are locally
manifestable with SHA-256 digests.

## Committed trust-cockpit run

The Trust Cockpit is a reviewer-facing evidence surface added after comparative
research across GitHub, mobile app stores and relevant app marketplaces. The
research note is here: [`docs/competitive-research-2026-06-30.md`](docs/competitive-research-2026-06-30.md).

- [`examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.md`](examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.md)
- [`examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.json`](examples/trust-cockpit-saas-msa-2026-06-30.json)

The cockpit snapshot records the same synthetic SaaS MSA fixture, the canonical
CLI command, schema version, Python version, review state, disabled external
actions, source boundary, commitments, owners, SLA, local artifact digests and
next actions.

## Committed audit chain proof

The audit trail is a SHA-256 hash chain: each event commits to the hash of the one
before it, so altering, reordering or dropping a past event is detectable, and export
is blocked if the chain does not verify.

- [`examples/audit-chain-saas-msa-2026-06-30.json`](examples/audit-chain-saas-msa-2026-06-30.json)

The snapshot is generated from the same synthetic SaaS MSA fixture after a documented
human approval, and shows a two-event chain (`assessment_created`,
`review_decision_applied`) that verifies.

Hash-chained audit logging is an established technique implemented by several open-source
projects, including at least one MCP-exposed audit tool for general AI agent
actions. The differentiator here is narrower and specific: pairing that hash chain
with a legal-matter review workflow: typed intake, deterministic risk triage,
reviewer routing, and an export gate the chain itself can block, in one
reviewer-facing evidence packet. See
[`docs/competitive-research-2026-06-30.md`](docs/competitive-research-2026-06-30.md#round-2-audit-integrity-chain)
for the comparison this claim is based on.

## Design principles

- Human review before consequential use.
- Deterministic rules before model synthesis.
- Pydantic schemas for every handoff.
- Review notes required for approval, rejection and escalation.
- Blocked source prefixes for client, candidate, privileged and confidential material.
- Public regulatory source verification without external fetching.
- Local MCP configuration for controlled tool access.
- Synthetic sample data only.

## Checks

```bash
make check
```

This runs Ruff, Black, MyPy and Pytest.

## MCP surface

`mcp.json` exposes a local `legal-ops-agent` server with eight controlled tools:

- `legal.matter.assess`: create a structured assessment from a typed legal matter.
- `legal.review.decide`: apply a documented human review decision.
- `legal.review.packet`: render a markdown review packet from an assessment.
- `legal.review.packet.run`: assess a matter and return the source-verified packet, source manifest and policy envelope in one payload.
- `legal.review.trust_cockpit`: assess a matter and return reviewer evidence for review gates, source boundary, commitments and artifact integrity.
- `legal.audit.verify`: verify the tamper-evident hash chain on an assessment's audit trail.
- `legal.sources.list`: show the public or synthetic source boundary for the demo.
- `legal.sources.verify`: verify source-reference boundaries without fetching external content.
- `legal.workspace.build`: build a provenance-backed matter vault, supervised workflow-agent library and shared review room from a synthetic assessment.

The local Review-workspace layer adds versioned matter playbooks, review-gated `document.change-set.v1` DOCX drafts, evidence-gated matter Lists with a hash-chained timeline, and a self-contained HTML review room. Sensitive source prefixes still block processing and no external delivery action is available.

These tools are designed for local verification. They do not send client, candidate, matter or account data to an external system.

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for input schemas, output schemas, safety limits
and example calls.

## Verified behavior

This repository demonstrates supervised legal operations as software. It shows
typed intake, deterministic triage, source-boundary controls, reviewer routing,
human approval gates, artifact manifests and local MCP-style tool calls. The
important signal is the control model: automation prepares the matter, but a
qualified human decision controls export.

## Safety note

This is a prototype. It does not provide legal advice, legal representation or filing-ready regulatory conclusions. Consequential legal work requires qualified human review, source verification and organisation-specific controls.

## Human-authored legal judgment
AI tools assisted the implementation, but the parts that carry the value are
human-authored: the matter schema, the deterministic risk rules, the reviewer-routing logic, and the approval gates. The point of this repository is not code volume; it is showing
how legal judgment can be made structured, testable, and reviewable.

## Why lawyers should care
It keeps agentic work accountable: structured intake, visible assumptions, and an
approval gate that blocks export until a human signs off, with an audit trail.

## Why product teams should care
It is a reference pattern for safe agentic actions: deterministic checks before model
synthesis, typed schemas, routing by risk, and export control, the parts a security
or risk reviewer asks about before a tool ships.

## Known limitations
A public-safe prototype, not a production system.
1. Synthetic matters only; no real DMS, identity provider, or e-signature.
2. Triage thresholds are illustrative defaults, to be tuned per team.
3. The audit trail is tamper-evident (hash-chained, verifiable with `legal.audit.verify`)
   but still in-process, not persisted to an append-only external store.
4. Roles/permissions are modelled, not enforced against a real IdP.
Next production step: real auth for approval tiers, ticketing integration, live SLA
tracking, and persisting the hash-chained audit log to an append-only external store.
